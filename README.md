# Vision-Decentralized-Offline-Chatbot
1. Developed a Vision-based Decentralized Offline Chatbot leveraging Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for robust image-based interaction.
2. Implemented VGG Transfer Learning for advanced image processing and prediction accuracy enhancement.
3. Utilized IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized and secure image storage and retrieval.
4. Designed and integrated backend functionalities with Python (Flask), ensuring seamless interaction between ML models and the chatbot interface.
5. Enhanced system efficiency using a modular architecture, including segmentation algorithms, image-to-text conversion, and classification models.
6. Followed containerization best practices with Docker, enabling cross-platform compatibility and streamlined deployment.
7. Collaborated with LLM (Large Language Model) components for context-based user interaction.
